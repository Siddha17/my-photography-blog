## About Me

Hello! I'm Siddha Lakshmi Prasanna, a passionate photographer with a love for capturing the beauty of the natural world. I specialize in landscape and wildlife photography but also enjoy experimenting with urban and portrait photography.

### My Photography Journey
I started photography 5 years ago as a hobby, using just my smartphone to capture moments during hikes, trips with my family and friends. Over time, I developed a deeper connection with nature and decided to invest in professional gear. Since then, photography has become an essential part of my life.

### Photography Style
My photography focuses on:
- **Landscapes**: Capturing vast mountains, serene beaches, and everything in between.
- **Wildlife**: Documenting animals in their natural habitat.
- **Urban scenes**: Street photography that tells the story of everyday life.
